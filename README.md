# Debris

Hopefully, this will be a production-ready app kind of like a _project manager_ to keep track of the books, courses, docs, etc, that I study on a daily basis and that I don't really have a notion of completion or progress. 

Working on this app in my spare time is also a way to be motivated to continue learning and a place where I can apply the concepts I acquire.
